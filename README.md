# Audio watermarking
Implementations of different audio watermarking techniques.

## FSVC watermarking
Paper: Desynchronization Attacks Resilient Watermarking Method Based on Frequency Singular Value Coefficient Modification https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9468371.

## Patchwork-based watermarking
Paper: Patchwork-Based Multilayer Audio Watermarking https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8025572.

Note: This paper proposes mulilayer watermark embedding. Technique implemented here embeds watermark bits only in the first layer.

## Norm space watermarking

Paper: Novel secured scheme for blind audio/speech norm-space watermarking by Arnold algorithm https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2018.08.011.

## DCT-b1 watermarking

Paper: Robust, transparent and high-capacity audio watermarking in DCT domain https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.11.011.

Note: This paper proposes multiple techniques for audio watermark embedding. The technique for embedding watermark bits in the first band of DCT coefficients (DCT-b1) has been implemented here.
